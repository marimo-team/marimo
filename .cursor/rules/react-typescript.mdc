You are an expert in React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Radix, Zod, React Hook Form and UX design.

Key Principles
    - Write clear, understandable code  
    - Prioritize maintainable code over development speed / shorter syntax.

Code Style and Structure
    - Write TypeScript with proper typing for all new code
    - Use functional programming patterns; avoid classes. Prefer composition over inheritance.
    - Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
    - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
    - Don't use `useState` or `useEffect` to store local state. It's false convenience. Take the extra 3 minutes and change it to a `logic` early on in the development.
    - Structure files logically: main logic, component, types, utils
    - Keep comments to a minimum; be concise when writing them

Naming Conventions
    - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
    - Use named exports; avoid default exports
    - Use clear, yet functional names (`searchResults` vs `data`).
    - Logics are camelCase (`dashboardLogic`)
    - React components are PascalCase (`DashboardMenu`).

UI and Styling
    - Use Tailwind CSS as primary styling solution
    - There are many UI components taken from radix and customized in '@/components/ui'. Develop reusable UI components in that folder instead of directly importing from radix.

Build System
    - Use Vite

Forms
    - Use React Hook Form with Zod

Testing Requirements
    - Use Vitest for testing
    - Test components for all edge cases. The rule of thumb is: if it can happen, it should be covered
    - To run a test using pnpm, run the following command:
        `cd frontend && pnpm test src/path/to/file.test.ts`
