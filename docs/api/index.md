Use the marimo library in marimo notebooks (`import marimo as mo`) to connect
interactive components like sliders, dropdowns, and tables to Python, layout
information with tabs or grids, output media like images and audio, express
yourself with dynamically created markdown (parametrized by Python values!),
and more.
