# Layouts

```{eval-rst}
.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1
  :hidden:

  accordion
  callout
  image
  justify
  stacks
  tabs
  tree
```

marimo has higher-order layout elements. Unlike elements in `marimo.ui`, these
don't have any values associated with them but just render their children in a
certain way.

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
  :nosignatures:

  marimo.accordion
  marimo.callout
  marimo.center
  marimo.hstack
  marimo.image
  marimo.left
  marimo.right
  marimo.vstack
  marimo.tabs
  marimo.tree
```
