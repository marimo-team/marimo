# Loading

Many use-cases in marimo involve loading data from files, databases, or APIs. This can take some time and not be apparent to the end-user. marimo provides a few utilities to help with this.

## Spinner

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: marimo.loading.spinner
```

## Progress indicators

You can display a progress indicator in a cell's output area while it's running. And incrementally update it as you go.

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: marimo.loading.start
```
