# Query Parameters

Use `mo.query_params` to access query parameters passed to the notebook. You
can also use `mo.query_params` to set query parameters in order to keep track
of state in the URL. This is useful for bookmarking or sharing a particular
state of the notebook while running as an application with `marimo run`.

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: marimo.query_params
```
