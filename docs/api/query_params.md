# Query Parameters

Use `mo.query_params` to access query parameters passed to the notebook. You can also
use `mo.query_params` to set query parameters in order to keep track of state in the
URL. This is useful for bookmarking or sharing a particular state of the notebook while in running as an application.

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: marimo.query_params
```
