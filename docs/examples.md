# Examples

We have a large library of examples in
[our repo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/tree/main/examples). Each
example encapsulates its own Python dependencies, making it easy to run.
We've deployed some of these examples at our [public
gallery](https://marimo.io/@public).

We spotlight projects from the community each week; check out our
[spotlights repo](https://github.com/marimo-team/spotlights) for a running
archive, with links to notebooks.
