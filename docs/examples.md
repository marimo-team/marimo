# Examples

We have a large [library of
examples](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/tree/main/examples) in our
repo. Each example [encapsulates its own Python dependencies in a package
sandbox](guides/editor_features/package_management.md), making it easy to run.
We've deployed some of these examples at our [public
gallery](https://marimo.io/@public).

We spotlight projects from the community each week on [our Twitter](https://x.com/marimo_io); check out our
[spotlights repo](https://github.com/marimo-team/spotlights) for a running
archive, with links to notebooks.
