# Installation

Before installing marimo, we recommend creating and activating a Python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).

??? note "Setting up a virtual environment"

    Python uses virtual environments to minimize conflicts among packages.
    Here's a quickstart for `pip` users. If you use `conda`, please use a [`conda`
    environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
    instead.

    Run the following in the terminal:

    - create an environment with `python -m venv marimo-env`
    - activate the environment:
      - macOS/Unix: `source marimo-env/bin/activate`
      - Windows: `marimo-env\Scripts\activate`

    _Make sure the environment is activated before installing marimo and when
    using marimo._ Install other packages you may need, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib,
    and altair, in this environment. When you're done, deactivate the environment
    with `deactivate` in the terminal.

    Learn more from the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).

/// admonition | Using uv?
    type: tip

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a next-generation Python package
installer and manager that is 10-100x faster than pip, and also makes it easy
to install Python and manage projects. With `uv`, creating a virtual
environment is as easy as `uv venv`.
///

## Install with minimal dependencies

To install marimo, run the following in a terminal:

/// tab | install with pip

```bash
pip install marimo
```

///

/// tab | install with uv

```bash
uv pip install marimo
```

///

/// tab | install with conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge marimo
```

///

To check if the install worked, run

```bash
marimo tutorial intro
```

A tutorial notebook should open in your browser.

## Install with recommended dependencies

marimo is lightweight, with few dependencies, to maximize compatibility with
your own environments.

To unlock additional features in the marimo editor, including SQL cells,
AI completion, server-side plotting of dataframe columns, and more, we
suggest installing `marimo[recommended]`:

/// tab | install with pip

```bash
pip install marimo[recommended]
```

///

/// tab | install with uv

```bash
uv pip install marimo[recommended]
```

///

/// tab | install with conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge marimo "duckdb>=1.0.0" "altair>=5.4.0" pyarrow "polars>=1.9.0" "sqlglot>=23.4" "openai>=1.55.3" "ruff" "nbformat>=5.7.0" "vegafusion>=2.0.0" "vl-convert-python>=1.0.0"
```

///

Installing marimo in this way installs the following additional dependencies and unlocks the following features:

| Dependency                 | Feature                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| duckdb>=1.0.0              | SQL cells                        |
| altair>=5.4.0              | Plotting in datasource viewer   |
| polars[pyarrow]>=1.9.0     | SQL output back in Python       |
| sqlglot>=23.4              | SQL cells parsing               |
| openai>=1.55.3             | AI features                     |
| ruff                       | Formatting                      |
| nbformat>=5.7.0            | Export as IPYNB                 |
| vegafusion>=2.0.0          | Performant charting             |
| vl-convert-python>=1.0.0   | Required by vegafusion          |
