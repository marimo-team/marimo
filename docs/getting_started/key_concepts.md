# Key concepts

This page covers marimo's key concepts:

* marimo lets you rapidly experiment with data using Python, SQL, and interactive
elements in a reproducible **notebook environment**.
* Unlike Jupyter notebooks, marimo notebooks are reusable software artifacts.
  marimo notebooks can be shared as as **interactive web apps** and executed as
  **Python scripts**.

## Editing notebooks

marimo notebooks are **reactive**: they automatically react to your code
changes and UI interactions and keep your notebook up-to-date, not unlike a
spreadsheet. This makes your notebooks reproducible, [eliminating hidden
state](../faq.md#faq-problems); it's also what enables marimo notebooks to double as
apps and Python scripts.

!!! important "Working with expensive notebooks"

    If you don't want cells to run automatically, the [runtime can be
    configured](../guides/configuration/runtime_configuration.md) to be lazy, only
    running cells when you ask for them to be run and marking affected cells as
    stale. **See our guide on working with [expensive
    notebooks](../guides/expensive_notebooks.md) for more tips.**

**Create your first notebook.** After [installing
marimo](../getting_started/installation.md), create your first notebook with

```bash
marimo edit my_notebook.py
```

at the command-line.

**The marimo library**.
We recommend starting each marimo notebook with a cell containing a single
line of code,

```python3
import marimo as mo
```

The marimo library lets you use interactive UI elements, layout elements,
dynamic markdown, and more in your marimo notebooks.

### How marimo executes cells

A marimo notebook is made of small blocks of Python code called **cells**.
_When you run a cell, marimo automatically runs all cells that read any global
variables defined by that cell._ This is reactive execution.

<div align="center">
<figure>
<video autoplay muted loop width="600px" align="center" src="/_static/reactive.webm">
</video>
</figure>
</div>

**Execution order.**
The order of cells on the page has no bearing on the order cells are
executed in: execution order is determined by the variables
cells define and the variables they read.

You have full freedom over how to organize your code and tell your stories:
move helper functions and other "appendices" to the bottom of your notebook, or
put cells with important outputs at the top.

**No hidden state.**
marimo notebooks have no hidden state because the program state is
automatically synchronized with your code changes and UI interactions. And if
you delete a cell, marimo automatically deletes that cell's variables,
preventing painful bugs that arise in traditional notebooks.

**No magical syntax.**
There's no magical syntax or API required to opt-in to reactivity: cells are
Python and _only Python_. Behind-the-scenes, marimo statically analyzes each
cell's code just once, creating a directed acyclic graph based on the
global names each cell defines and reads. This is how data flows
in a marimo notebook.

!!! warning "Minimize variable mutation."

    marimo's understanding of your code is based on variable definitions and
    references; marimo does not track mutations to objects at runtime. For this
    reason, if you need to mutate a variable (such as adding a new column to a
    dataframe), you should perform the mutation in the same cell as the one that
    defines it.

Learn more in our [reactivity guide](../guides/reactivity.md#reactivity-mutations).

For more on reactive execution, open the dataflow tutorial

```bash
marimo tutorial dataflow
```

or read the [reactivity guide](../guides/reactivity.md).

### Visualizing outputs

marimo visualizes the last expression of each cell as its **output**. Outputs
can be any Python value, including markdown and interactive elements created
with the marimo library, (_e.g._, [`mo.md`][marimo.md], [`mo.ui.slider`][marimo.ui.slider]).
You can even interpolate Python values into markdown (using `mo.md(f"...")`) and
other marimo elements to build rich composite outputs:

<div align="center">
<figure>
<video autoplay muted loop width="600px" align="center" src="/_static/outputs.webm">
</video>
</figure>
</div>

> Thanks to reactive execution, running a cell refreshes all the relevant outputs in your notebook.

The marimo library also comes with elements for laying out outputs, including
[`mo.hstack`][marimo.hstack], [`mo.vstack`][marimo.vstack],
[`mo.accordion`][marimo.accordion], [`mo.ui.tabs`][marimo.ui.tabs], [`mo.sidebar`][marimo.sidebar],
[`mo.nav_menu`][marimo.nav_menu], [`mo.ui.table`][marimo.ui.table],
and [many more](../api/layouts/index.md).

For more on outputs, try these tutorials:

```bash
marimo tutorial markdown
marimo tutorial plots
marimo tutorial layout
```

or read the [visualizing outputs guide](../guides/outputs.md).

### Creating interactive elements

The marimo library comes with many interactive stateful elements in
[`marimo.ui`](../api/inputs/index.md), including simple ones like sliders, dropdowns, text fields, and file
upload areas, as well as composite ones like forms, arrays, and dictionaries
that can wrap other UI elements.

<div align="center">
<figure>
<video autoplay muted loop width="600px" align="center" src="/_static/readme-ui.webm">
</video>
</figure>
</div>

**Using UI elements.**
To use a UI element, create it with `mo.ui` and **assign it to a global
variable.** When you interact with a UI element in your browser (_e.g._,
sliding a slider), _marimo sends the new value back to Python and reactively
runs all cells that use the element_, which you can access via its `value`
attribute.

> **This combination of interactivity and reactivity is very powerful**: use it
> to make your data tangible during exploration and to build all kinds of tools
> and apps.

_marimo can only synchronize UI elements that are assigned to
global variables._ Use composite elements like [`mo.ui.array`][marimo.ui.array] and
[`mo.ui.dictionary`][marimo.ui.dictionary] if the set of UI elements is not
known until runtime.

!!! tip "Using buttons to execute cells"

    Use [`mo.ui.run_button`][marimo.ui.run_button] to create a button that
    triggers computation when clicked; see our recipes for [an example](../recipes.md#create-a-button-that-triggers-computation-when-clicked).

For more on interactive elements, run the UI tutorial

```bash
marimo tutorial ui
```

or read the [interactivity guide](../guides/interactivity.md).

### Querying dataframes and databases with SQL

marimo has built-in support for SQL: you can query Python dataframes,
databases, CSVs, Google Sheets, or anything else. After executing your query,
marimo returns the result to you as a dataframe, making it seamless
to go back and forth between SQL and Python.

<div align="center">
  <figure>
    <img src="/_static/docs-sql-df.png"/>
    <figcaption>Query a dataframe using SQL!</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

To create a SQL cell, click on the SQL button that appears at the bottom of the
cell array, or right click the create cell button next to a cell. Today,
SQL in marimo is executed using [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/).

To learn more, run the SQL tutorial

```bash
marimo tutorial sql
```

or read the [SQL guide](../guides/working_with_data/sql.md).

## Running notebooks as applications

You can use marimo as a notebook, similar to how you might use Jupyter.

But you can also do more: because marimo notebooks are reactive and can include
interactive elements, hiding notebook code gives you a simple web app!

You can run your notebook as a read-only web app from the command-line:

```bash
marimo run my_notebook.py
```

The default renderer just hides the notebook code and concatenates outputs
vertically. But marimo also supports [other layouts](../guides/apps.md),
such as slides and grid.

## Running notebooks as scripts

Because marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python files, each notebook
can be executed as a script from the command-line:

```python
python my_notebook.py
```

You can also [pass command-line arguments](../guides/scripts.md) to scripts.
