# AI completion

marimo comes with GitHub Copilot, a tool that helps you write code faster by
suggesting in-line code suggestions based on the context of your current code.

marimo also comes with the ability to use AI for refactoring a cell, finishing writing a cell, or writing a full cell from scratch.
This feature is currently experimental and is not enabled by default.

## GitHub Copilot

The marimo editor natively supports [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/),
an AI pair programmer, similar to VS Code.

_Get started with Copilot_:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Enable Copilot via the settings menu in the marimo editor.

_Note_: Copilot is not yet available in our conda distribution; please install
marimo using `pip` if you need Copilot.

## Codeium Copilot

1. Go to the Codeium website and sign up for an account: <https://codeium.com/>
2. Install the browser extension: <https://codeium.com/chrome_tutorial>
3. Open the settings for the Chrome extension and click on "Get Token"

4. Right-click on the extension window and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools for the extension. Then click on "Network"
5. Copy the token and paste it into the input area, and then press "Enter Token"
6. This action will log a new API request in the **Network** tab. Click on "Preview" to get the API key.

7. Paste the API key in the marimo settings in the UI, or add it to your `~/.marimo.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[completion]
copilot = "codeium"
codeium_api_key = ""
```

## Using AI to modify cells

This feature is currently experimental and is not enabled by default. To enable it:

1. Install openai: `pip install openai`

2. Add the following to your `~/.marimo.toml`:

```toml
[ai.open_ai]
# Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
api_key = "sk-..."
# Choose a model, we recommend "gpt-4-turbo"
model = "gpt-4-turbo"
# Change the base_url if you are using a different OpenAI-compatible API
base_url = "https://api.openai.com"
```

Once enabled, you can use AI completion by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-e` in a
cell. This will open an input to modify the cell using AI.

</div>

### Using other AI providers

marimo supports OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API by default. If your provider is compatible with OpenAI's API, you can use it by changing the `base_url` in the configuration.

For other providers not compatible with OpenAI's API, please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/issues) or "thumbs up" an existing one.
