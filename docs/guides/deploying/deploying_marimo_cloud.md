# Deploy to Marimo Cloud

To deploy marimo notebooks and apps to production, with access controls,
schedules, and more, you can use **Marimo Cloud**. Using Marimo Cloud, you can
deploy either on our cloud servers or your own (we'll bring the software).

Marimo Cloud is currently in beta: if you'd like access, email us at
[contact@marimo.io](mailto:contact@marimo.io) or book time on [our
calendar](calendly.com/akshay-marimo) and we'll onboard you very quickly.

## Marimo Cloud

Marimo Cloud seamlessly augments local development on marimo notebooks with
on-demand cloud resources for experimentation, batch processing, sharing, and
deployment.

Today, marimo cloud has two main features:

1. deploy marimo notebooks as interactive web apps internally or to the public, with access controls;
2. collaborate on an unlimited number of [WASM-powered](/guides/wasm.md) marimo
   notebooks, with mounted storage and GitHub sync.

We have many more features planned for the near future, and **big ideas** on
how Marimo Cloud can supercharge the entire lifecycle of working with and
experimenting on data, from small workloads to very large ones as well.
