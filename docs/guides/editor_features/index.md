# Editor features

The **marimo editor** is the browser-based IDE in which you write marimo
notebooks. We've taken a batteries-included approach to designing the editor:
it comes _packed_ with features to make you productive when working
with code and data.

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Overview](overview.md) | An overview of editor features and configuration |
| [Package Management](package_management.md) | Using package managers in marimo |
| [AI Completion](ai_completion.md) | Code with the help of a language model |
| [Language Server](language_server.md) | Code intelligence via LSP |
| [Hotkeys](hotkeys.md) | Our hotkeys |

Highlights include:

- a variables panel that lets you explore variable values and see where they are defined
- a data explorer that lets you inspect dataframes and tables at a glance
- smart module autoreloading that tells you which cells need to be rerun
- code completion
- GitHub Copilot
- language-model assisted coding
- language server protocol (LSP) for diagnostics and code intelligence
- vim keybindings
- live documentation preiews as you type

and much more.
