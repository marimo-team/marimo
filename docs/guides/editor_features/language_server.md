# Language Server Protocol (LSP)

!!! warning "Experimental Feature"

    LSP support in marimo is currently an experimental feature. It may have bugs or performance issues. To enable it add the following to your `pyproject.toml` file:

    ```toml title="pyproject.toml"
    [tool.marimo.experimental]
    lsp = true
    ```

The marimo editor supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to provide enhanced code intelligence features like:

- Code completion
- Hover information
- Go to definition
- Error checking and diagnostics

## Installation

LSP support requires additional dependencies. You can install them with:

```bash
pip install "marimo[lsp]"
# or
uv add marimo[lsp]
# or
conda install -c conda-forge python-lsp-server python-lsp-ruff
```

This will install the necessary packages including:

- [`python-lsp-server`](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server): The core Python language server
- `python-lsp-ruff`: Ruff integration for fast linting

You may optionally install other `pylsp` plugins.

!!! note "Other Python Language Servers"

    Support for other Python language servers is planned for future releases.

## Configuration

LSP support can be configured in your `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.marimo.experimental]
lsp = true
```

```toml title="pyproject.toml"

# Language server configuration
[tool.marimo.language_servers.pylsp]
enabled = true               # Enable/disable the Python language server
enable_mypy = true           # Type checking with mypy (enabled by default, if installed)
enable_ruff = true           # Linting with ruff (enabled by default, if installed)
enable_flake8 = false        # Linting with flake8
enable_pydocstyle = false    # Check docstring style
enable_pylint = false        # Linting with pylint
enable_pyflakes = false      # Syntax checking with pyflakes

# Diagnostics configuration
[tool.marimo.diagnostics]
enabled = true               # Show diagnostics in the editor
```

## WebAssembly

Language Servers are not available when running marimo in WebAssembly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the language server:

1. Make sure you've installed the required dependencies with `pip install "marimo[lsp]"`
2. Check if the language server is enabled in your configuration
3. Try restarting the marimo server
4. Check the terminal for any error messages
