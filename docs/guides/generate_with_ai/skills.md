# Skills

We have prepared a collection of skills to help coding agents work with marimo.
Install our official skills with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add marimo-team/skills
```

**Use cases.** Use these skills to

- convert Jupyter notebooks or other artifacts to marimo notebooks,
- make bespoke interactive UI elements or widgets for specific use cases,
- and otherwise author high-quality standalone notebooks.

**Feedback.** We welcome feedback at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marimo-team/skills/issues).

## What are skills?

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude and
other agents load dynamically to improve performance on specialized
tasks.
