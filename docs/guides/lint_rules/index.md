# Lint Rules

marimo includes a comprehensive linting system that helps you write better, more reliable notebooks. The linter checks for various issues that could prevent your notebook from running correctly or cause confusion.

## How to Use

You can run the linter using the CLI:

```bash
# Check all notebooks in current directory
marimo check .

# Check specific files
marimo check notebook1.py notebook2.py

# Auto-fix fixable issues
marimo check --fix .
```

## Rule Categories

marimo's lint rules are organized into three main categories based on their severity:

### üö® Breaking Rules

These errors prevent notebook execution.

| [MB004](rules/setup_cell_dependencies.md) | setup-cell-dependencies | Setup cell cannot have dependencies | ‚ùå |

### ‚ú® Formatting Rules

These are style and formatting issues.
