# Community Cloud

Our [Community Cloud](https://marimo.io/dashboard) is a free workspace
for creating, saving, and sharing marimo notebooks. Unlike the
[Playground](../playground.md), the Community Cloud requires a login. In
return, it lets you save noteoboks, share them using email-based authorization,
and upload a limited amount of data.

!!! note "WebAssembly notebooks only"

    Currently, the Community Cloud only allows the creation of [WebAssembly
    notebooks](../../wasm.md). These are easy to share and embed in other
    web pages, but have some limitations in packages and performance.

Note: unlike our other publishing options, it is not possible to embed
editable Community Cloud notebooks in other web pages.
