# From GitHub

marimo makes it very easy to share links to executable notebooks from notebooks
hosted on GitHub. Unlike Google Colab, marimo also automatically synchronizes
data stored in your GitHub repo to the notebook's filesystem, making it
easy to bundle data with your notebooks.


- Publish notebooks to [GitHub Pages](github_pages.md)
- Edit notebooks on the [marimo playground](playground.md), with public link-based sharing
  (no login required!)
- Synchronize to our [Community Cloud](community_cloud/index.md) for email-based sharing
