# Publishing notebooks to the web

You can publish marimo notebooks to the web as interactive editable notebooks,
readonly web apps, or [static documents](../exporting.md).

Thanks to [WebAssembly](../wasm.md), you can even share executable
notebooks on GitHub Pages or other static sites without paying for backend
infrastrcture. This makes it easy to share your work with colleagues, embed
executable notebooks in web documentation or educational websites, and more.

This guide provides an overview of the various ways to publish marimo notebooks.
