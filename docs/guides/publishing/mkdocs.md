# Publishing with MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a widely used static site generator that uses plain markdown files as page inputs.

You can use MkDocs to publish your marimo notebooks as a interactive website with marimo's [MkDocs extension](https://github.com/marimo-team/mkdocs-marimo).
