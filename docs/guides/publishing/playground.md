# Online playground

Our [online playground](https://marimo.app) lets you
create and share marimo notebooks for free, without creating an account.

Playground notebooks are great for embedding in other web pages â€” all the
embedded notebooks in marimo's own docs are playground notebooks. They
are also great for sharing via links.

**Try our playground!** Just navigate to
[https://marimo.new](https://marimo.new).

!!! note "WebAssembly notebooks only"

    Currently, the online playground only allows the creation of [WebAssembly
    notebooks](../wasm.md). These are easy to share and embed in other
    web pages, but have some limitations in packages and performance.

_The notebook embedded below is a playground notebook!_

## Creating and sharing playground notebooks { #creating-and-sharing-playground-notebooks }

Playground notebooks run at [marimo.app](https://marimo.app).

### New notebooks

To create a new playground notebook, visit <https://marimo.new>.

Think of [marimo.new](https://marimo.new) as a
scratchpad for experimenting with code, data, and models and for prototyping
tools, available to you at all times and on all devices.

!!! tip "Saving playground notebooks"

    When you save a WASM notebook, a copy of your code is saved to your
    web browser's local storage. When you return to
    [marimo.app](https://marimo.app), the last notebook you worked on will be
    re-opened. You can also click a button to save your notebook to
    the [Community Cloud](community_cloud/index.md).

### Share via links

At [marimo.app](https://marimo.app), save your notebook and then click the
`Create permalink` button to generate a shareable permalink to your
notebook.

Please be aware that marimo permalinks are publicly accessible.

### Open notebooks hosted on GitHub

To open notebooks hosted on GitHub in the playground, just
navigate to `https://marimo.app/path/to/notebook.py`. For example:
<https://marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/examples/ui/slider.py>.

!!! tip "Use our bookmarklet!"

    For a convenient way to create notebooks from GitHub, drag and drop the
    following button to your bookmarks bar:

    <a href="javascript:(function(){if(!location.href.endsWith('.py')&&!location.href.endsWith('.ipynb')){alert('Please use this bookmarklet on a URL ending with .py or .ipynb');return;}let url=window.location.href.replace(/^https:\/\//,'');window.open('https://marimo.app/' + url, '_blank');})();"
          style="padding: 5px 10px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold;">
    Open in marimo
    </a>

    Clicking the bookmark when you are viewing a notebook will
    open it in [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/).

!!! tip "From Jupyter notebooks"

    You can also create Playground notebooks from Jupyter notebooks hosted
    on GitHub. marimo will attempt to automatically convert the notebook
    to a marimo notebook.

#### Including data files

Notebooks created from GitHub links have the entire contents of the repository
mounted into the notebook's filesystem. This lets you work with files
using regular Python file I/O!

When constructing paths to data files, make sure to use
[`mo.notebook_dir()`][marimo.notebook_dir] to ensure that paths work both
locally and in the playground.

!!! example "Example"

    Navigate to

    <https://marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/examples/misc/notebook_dir.py>

    and open the file explorer panel to see all the files available to the notebook.

#### Open in marimo badge

Include an "open in marimo" badge in your README to link to playground
notebooks hosted on GitHub:

[![Open with marimo](https://marimo.io/shield.svg)](https://marimo.app/GITHUB_URL)

=== "Markdown"

     Replace `GITHUB_URL` with the URL to a notebook on GitHub.

     ```markdown
     [![Open with marimo](https://marimo.io/shield.svg)](https://marimo.app/GITHUB_URL)
     ```

=== "HTML"

     Replace `GITHUB_URL` with the URL to a notebook on GitHub.

     ```html
     <a href="https://marimo.app/GITHUB_URL" target="_blank">
         <img alt="Open in marimo" src="https://marimo.io/shield.svg" />
     </a>
     ```

### Creating playground notebooks from local notebooks

In the marimo editor's notebook action menu, use `Share > Create WebAssembly
link` to get a `marimo.app/...` URL representing your notebook:

<div align="center">
<figure>
<video autoplay muted loop width="100%" height="100%" align="center" src="/_static/share-wasm-link.webm">
</video>
</figure>
</div>

WASM notebooks come with common Python packages installed, but you may need to
[install additional packages using micropip](../wasm.md#supported-packages).

The obtained URL encodes your notebook code as a parameter, so it can be
quite long. If you want a URL that's easier to share, you can [create a
shareable permalink](#share-via-links).

## Configuration

Your `marimo.app` URLs can be configured using the following parameters.

### Read-only mode

To view a notebook in read-only mode, with
code cells locked, append `&mode=read` to your URL's list of query parameters
(or `?mode=read` if your URL doesn't have a query string).

Example:

- `https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?mode=read`

### Hide header for embedding

To hide the `marimo.app` header, append `&embed=true` to your URL's list of query
parameters (or `?embed=true` if your URL doesn't have a query string).

Example:

- `https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?embed=true`
- `https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?mode=read&embed=true`

See the [section on embedding](#embedding-in-other-web-pages) for examples of
how to embed marimo notebooks in your own webpages.

### Excluding code

By default, WASM notebooks expose your Python code to viewers. If you've
enabled read-only mode, you can exclude code with
`&include-code=false`. If you want to include code but have it be hidden
by default, use the parameter `&show-code=false`.

A sufficiently determined user would still be able
to obtain your code, so **don't** think of this as a security feature; instead,
think of it as an aesthetic or practical choice.

## Embedding in other web pages

WASM notebooks can be embedded into other webpages using the HTML `<iframe>`
tag.

### Embedding a blank notebook

Use the following snippet to embed a blank marimo notebook into your web page,
providing your users with an interactive code playground.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://marimo.app/l/aojjhb?embed=true"
  width="100%"
  height="500"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

<iframe src="https://marimo.app/l/aojjhb?embed=true" width="100%" height="500" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

### Embedding an existing notebook

To embed existing marimo notebooks into a webpage, first, [obtain a
URL to your notebook](#creating-and-sharing-playground-notebooks), then put it in an iframe.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://marimo.app/l/c7h6pz?embed=true"
  width="100%"
  height="500"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

<iframe src="https://marimo.app/l/c7h6pz?embed=true" width="100%" height="500" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

### Embedding an existing notebook in read-only mode

You can optionally render embedded notebooks in read-only mode by appending
`&mode=read` to your URL.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://marimo.app/l/c7h6pz?mode=read&embed=true"
  width="100%"
  height="500"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

<iframe src="https://marimo.app/l/c7h6pz?mode=read&embed=true" width="100%" height="500" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
