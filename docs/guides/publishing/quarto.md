# Publishing with Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a commonly
used open-source scientific and technical
publishing system that can be used to create
documents, presentations, websites, and more.
Quarto supports a variety of output formats,
including HTML, PDF, and Word.

marimo's [Quarto extension](https://github.com/marimo-team/quarto-marimo) allows you to utilize Quarto on marimo's markdown format to produce interactive, reactive, webpages.

!!! tip "Try the markdown file format tutorial"
    Learn more with `marimo tutorial markdown-format` at the command line.

To encourage quarto support, `.qmd` and `.md` files are interchangeable to marimo as an editor.

Alternatively, see our [MkDocs guide](mkdocs.md) for other methods of publishing marimo's markdown format.
