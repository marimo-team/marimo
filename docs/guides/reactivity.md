# Reactive execution

Every marimo notebook is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that models how data
flows across blocks of Python code, i.e., cells.

marimo _react_ to code changes, automatically executing cells with the latest
data. Execution order is determined by the DAG, not by the order of cells on
the page.

Reactive execution is based on a single rule:

```{admonition} Runtime Rule
:class: important

When a cell is run, marimo automatically runs all other cells that
**reference** any of the global variables it **defines**.
```

```{admonition} Working with expensive notebooks
:class: tip

marimo gives you tools that make it easy to work with expensive notebooks. For
example, the [runtime can be
configured](#/guides/configuration/runtime_configuration.md) to be lazy, only
running cells when you ask for them to be run and marking affected cells as
stale instead of auto-running them. **See our guide on working with [expensive
notebooks](/guides/expensive_notebooks.md) for more tips.**
```

## References and definitions

A marimo notebook is a DAG where nodes are cells and edges are data
dependencies. marimo creates this graph by statically analyzing each cell
(i.e., without running it) to determine its

- references, the global variables it reads but doesn't define;
- definitions, the global variables it defines.

```{admonition} Global variables
:class: tip

A variable can refer to any Python object. Functions, classes, and imported
names are all variables.
```

There is an edge from one cell to another if the latter cell references any
global variables defined by the former cell. The rule for reactive execution
can be restated in terms of the graph: when a cell is run, its descendants are
run automatically.

## Global variable names must be unique

To make sure your notebook is DAG, marimo requires that every global
variable be defined by only one cell.

```{admonition} Local variables
:class: important

Variables prefixed with an underscore are local to a cell (_.e.g._, `_x`). You
can use this in a pinch to fix multiple definition errors, but try instead to
refactor your code.
```

This rule encourages you to keep the number of global variables in your
program small, which is generally considered good practice.

## Local variables

Global variables prefixed with an underscore (_e.g._, `_x`) are "local" to a
cell: they can't be read by other cells. Multiple cells can reuse the same
local variables names.

If you encapsulate your code using functions and classes when needed,
you won't need to use many local variables, if any.

## No hidden state

Traditional notebooks like Jupyter have _hidden state_: running a cell may
change the values of global variables, but these changes are not propagated to
the cells that use them. Worse, deleting a cell removes global
variables from visible code but _not_ from program memory, a common
source of bugs. The problem of hidden state has been discussed by
many others
[[1]](https://austinhenley.com/pubs/Chattopadhyay2020CHI_NotebookPainpoints.pdf)

**marimo eliminates hidden state**: running
a cell automatically refreshes downstream outputs, and _deleting a cell
deletes its global variables from program memory_.

## Avoid mutating variables

marimo's reactive execution is based only on the global variables a cell reads
and the global variables it defines. In particular, _marimo does not track
mutations to objects_, _i.e._, mutations don't trigger reactive re-runs of
other cells. It also does not track the definition or mutation of object
attributes. For this reason, **avoid defining a variable in one cell and
mutating it in another**.

If you need to mutate a variable (such as adding a new column to a dataframe),
you should perform the mutation in the same cell as the one that defines it,
Or try creating a new variable instead.

### Examples

**Create a new variable instead of mutating an existing one.**

_Don't_ do this:

```python
l = [1]
```

```python
l.append(2)
```

_Instead_, do this:

```python
l = [1]
```

```python
extended_list = l + [2]
```

**Mutate variables in the cells that define them.**

_Don't_ do this:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({"my_column": [1, 2]})
```

```python
df["another_column"] = [3, 4]
```

_Instead_, do this:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({"my_column": [1, 2]})
df["another_column"] = [3, 4]
```

```{admonition} Why not track mutations?
:class: note

Tracking mutations reliably is a fundamentally impossible task in Python; marimo
could never detect all mutations, and even if we could, reacting to mutations could
result in surprising re-runs of notebook cells. The simplicity of marimo's
static analysis approach, based only on variable definitions and references,
makes marimo easy to understand and encourages well-organized notebook code.
```

## Runtime configuration

Through the notebook settings menu, you can configure how and when marimo runs
cells. In particular, you can disable autorun on startup, disable autorun
on cell execution, and enable a powerful module autoreloader. Read our
[runtime configuration guide](/guides/configuration/runtime_configuration.md) to learn more.

## Disabling cells

Sometimes, you may want to edit one part of a notebook without triggering
automatic execution of its dependent cells. For example, the dependent cells
may take a long time to execute, and you only want to iterate on the first part
of a multi-cell computation.

For cases like this, marimo lets you **disable** cells: when a cell is
disabled, it and its dependents are blocked from running.

When you re-enable a cell, if any of the cell's ancestors ran while it was
disabled, marimo will automatically run it.
