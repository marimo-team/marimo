# Testing with doctest

You can test code snippets in docstrings using
[doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html), a Python module for
testing code snippets in documentation. This works because marimo notebooks are
just Python programs.

See this notebook for an example:

/// marimo-embed-file
    filepath: examples/testing/running_doctests.py
///
