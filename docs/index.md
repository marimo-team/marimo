**marimo** is a reactive notebook for Python that models notebooks
as dataflow graphs: run a cell or interact with a UI element, and marimo
automatically runs affected cells, keeping code and outputs consistent and
preventing bugs before they happen. Every marimo notebook is stored as pure
Python, executable as a script, and deployable as an app.

Developer experience is core to marimo, with an emphasis on
reproducibility, maintainability, composability, and shareability.

**Highlights.**

- **reactive**: run a cell and marimo automatically runs affected cells and updates their outputs
- **interactive**: bind sliders, tables, plots, and more to Python â€” no callbacks required
- **reproducible**: no hidden state, deterministic execution order â€” code with confidence in your notebook's correctness
- **deployable**: executable as a script, deployable as an app
- **developer-friendly**: git-friendly `.py` file format, GitHub Copilot, fast autocomplete, code formatting, and more
