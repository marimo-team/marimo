## Running an example

The requirements of each notebook are serialized in them as a top-level
comment. Here are the steps to open an example notebook:

1.[Install marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/index.html#installation).
2.[Install `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
3. Open an example with `marimo edit --sandbox <notebook.py>`.

> [!TIP]
> The `--sandbox` flag will open the notebook in an isolated virtual environment,
> automatically installing the notebook's dependencies.
