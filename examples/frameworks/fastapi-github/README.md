# Server marimo notebooks from a GitHub repository

In this example, we programmatically create multiple marimo apps from a GitHub repository, and then serve them as a single FastAPI app.

This example includes:

- Serving multiple marimo apps from a GitHub repository
- A home page listing all the apps
- Basic logging

## Running the app

1. [Install `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
2. Run the app with `uv run --no-project main.py`
