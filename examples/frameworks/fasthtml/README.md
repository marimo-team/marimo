# FastHTML + marimo

This is a simple example of how to use FastHTML with marimo. This example programmatically creates multiple marimo apps from a directory, and then serves them as a single FastHTML app.

## Running the app

1. [Install `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
2. Run the app with `uv run --no-project main.py`
