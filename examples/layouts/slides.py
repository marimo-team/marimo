        Creating the example data set
        We start by creating a data set that we'll use in the rest of the blog post. To this end, we define a table, populate it with some data and export it to a CSV file.

    {print_and_run(_SQL)}

        Wait a bit, that‚Äôs way too verbose! DuckDB‚Äôs syntax has several SQL shorthands including the ‚Äúfriendly SQL‚Äù clauses. Here, we combine the VALUES clause with the FROM-first syntax, which makes the SELECT clause optional. With these, we can compress the data creation script to ~60% of its original size. The new formulation omits the schema definition and creates the CSV with a single command:

        ```sql
        COPY (FROM VALUES ('foo', 10/9), ('bar', 50/7), ('qux', 9/4) t(s, x))
        TO 'example.csv';
        ```

        Regardless of which script we run, the resulting CSV file will look like this:


        {print_and_run("SELECT * from example")}

def __(mo, print_and_run):
    mo.md(
        f"""
        When printing a floating-point number to the output, the fractional parts can be difficult to read and compare. For example, the following query returns three numbers between 1 and 8 but their printed widths are very different due to their fractional parts.

        {print_and_run("SELECT x FROM 'example.csv';")}

        By casting a column to a DECIMAL with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point, we can pretty-print it as follows:

        {print_and_run('''
        SELECT x::DECIMAL(15, 3) AS x
        FROM 'example.csv';
        ''')}

        A typical alternative solution is to use the printf or format functions, e.g.:

        {print_and_run('''
        SELECT printf('%.3f', x)
        FROM 'example.csv';
        ''')}

        However, these approaches require us to specify a formatting string that's easy to forget. What's worse, the statement above returns string values, which makes subsequent operations (e.g., sorting) more difficult. Therefore, unless keeping the full precision of the floating-point numbers is a concern, casting to DECIMAL values should be the preferred solution for most use cases.

        To copy the schema from a table without copying its data, we can use LIMIT 0.

        {print_and_run('''
        CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE example AS
            FROM 'example.csv';
        CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE tbl AS
            FROM example
            LIMIT 0;
        ''')}

        This will result in an empty table with the same schema as the source table:

        {print_and_run('DESCRIBE tbl;')}

        This will return the schema of the table.

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE example(s VARCHAR, x DOUBLE);
        ```

        After editing the table‚Äôs name (e.g., example to tbl), this query can be used to create a new table with the same schema.

        Sometimes, we need to introduce some entropy into the ordering of the data by shuffling it. To shuffle non-deterministically, we can simply sort on a random value provided the random() function:

        {rerun}

        {print_and_run('''
        FROM 'example.csv' ORDER BY random();
        ''')}

        Shuffling deterministically is a bit more tricky. To achieve this, we can order on the hash, of the rowid pseudocolumn. Note that this column is only available in physical tables, so we first have to load the CSV in a table, then perform the shuffle operation as follows:

        {rerun}

        {print_and_run('''
        CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE example AS FROM 'example.csv';
        FROM example ORDER BY hash(rowid + 42);
        ''')}

        Note that the + 42 is only necessary to nudge the first row from its position ‚Äì as hash(0) returns 0, the smallest possible value, using it for ordering leaves the first row in its place.
