            - slowly degrades linearly over the years
            - has a periodic component with a period of 365 days
            - degrades and recover as panels are soiled and cleaned

            We've created what we think is a good decomposition for this
            data. Here it is:

            {mo.tree([reference_decomposition], label="reference decomposition")}

            **Your task:** Create a decomposition that matches our reference
            decomposition.
