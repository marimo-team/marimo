        marimo knows how your cells are related, and can automatically update
        outputs like a spreadsheet. This eliminates hidden state and hidden bugs, accelerates data exploration,
        and makes it possible for marimo to run your notebooks as scripts and web apps.
        For expensive notebooks, you can [turn this
        behavior off](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/expensive_notebooks/) via the notebook footer.
