            The **{component}** creates a component that treats values
            bigger and smaller than the component mean asymetrically. It's
            often used as a residual component class. Use the threshold
            parameter to control the trade-off between positive and negative
            values (or, when building a multiplicative decomposition, between
            values greater than and less than 1).

            The **{component}** class creates a component that is encouraged

            The **{component}** class creates a component that is encouraged
            to be small, with only a few non-zero entries but possible with some
            entries that are somewhat not small. It's often used as a residual

            The **{component}** class is a special class that wraps other
            component classes, creating a component that tries to have
            the properties of all its wrapped classes. For example,
            an aggregate of a Periodic and an Average Equal class
            creates a periodic component centered around a specific number,
            while an aggregate of a Periodic and Trend-line class creates
            a periodic component that varies smoothly.

            The **{component}** class creates a component that has a given

            The **{component}** class creates components that repeat
