# Charts

In order to maintain a consistent look and feel across all charts, we have a few components that are used to build the charts.

## Components

#### layouts
Thin wrappers around @ui components that provide consistent styling and behavior.

#### form-fields
Form fields that are used for chart forms. Wraps react-hook-form components

#### chart-items
Components that are used to build the charts. Groups together common form fields and layouts.

## Context

To keep each component light and avoid prop drilling, we can either use react-hook-form's `useFormContext` or `useContext` to access shared state (`context.ts`).
