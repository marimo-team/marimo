        Get cells that need to be run as a consequence of state updates

        A cell is marked as needing to run if all of the following are true:

            1. The runner was not interrupted.
            2. It was not already run after its setter was called.
            3. It isn't the cell that called the setter.

            5. It has among its refs the state object whose setter
               was invoked.

        (3) means that a state update in a given cell will never re-trigger
        the same cell to run. This is similar to how interacting with
        a UI element in the cell that created it won't re-trigger the cell,

        state object.
