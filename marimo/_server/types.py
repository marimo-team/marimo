    Minimal queue protocol used by Marimo.

    Defines the common subset of methods shared by `multiprocessing.Queue` and
    `queue.Queue` that Marimo depends on. Keeping this protocol minimal makes it
    straightforward to stub in `marimo-lsp` and to substitute alternative queue
    implementations (e.g., wrapping a ZeroMQ socket).

    If additional queue behavior becomes necessary, expand this protocol so that
    stubs and implementations stay aligned.
