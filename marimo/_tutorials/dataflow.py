        # How marimo notebooks run

        Reactive execution is based on a single rule: when a cell is run, all other
        cells that reference any of the global variables it defines run
        automatically.

        To provide reactive execution, marimo creates a dataflow graph out of your

        ## References and definitions

        A marimo notebook is a directed acyclic graph in which nodes represent 
        cells and edges represent data dependencies. marimo creates this graph by
        analyzing each cell (without running it) to determine its
        
        - references ("refs*), the global variables it reads but doesn't define;
        - definitions ("defs"), the global variables it defines.

        There is an edge from one cell to another if the latter cell references any
        global variables defined by the former cell.

        The rule for reactive execution can be restated in terms of the graph: when
        a cell is run, its descendants are run automatically.
