        Consider a marimo notebook with the following four cells.

        First cell:
        ```python3
        print(text.value)
        ```

        Second cell:
        ```python3
        def say_hello(name="World"):

        Third cell:
        ```python3

        text
        ```

        Fourth cell:

        app = marimo.App()

        editor, and format the file with your favorite code formatter.

        In the `dataflow` tutorial, we saw that cells are like functions mapping
        their refs (the global  variables they uses but don't define) to their
        defs (the global variables they define). The generated code makes this
        analogy explicit.

        In the generated code, there is a function for each cell. The arguments
        of  the function are the cell's refs , and its returned variables are
        its defs.

        For example, the code

        ```python3
        @app.cell
        def __(mo):

            text

        ```

        says that the cell takes as input a variable called `mo`, and it creates
        a global variable called `text`.

        ```python3

        cell requires as input.

        ### Setup Cell

        marimo can serialize functions and classes into the top-level of a file, so you can import them with regular Python syntax:

        ```python
        from my_notebook import my_function
        ```

        In particular, if a cell defines just a single function or class, and if that function or class is pure
        save for references to variables defined in a special **setup cell**, it will be serialized top-level.

        **Setup cell.** Notebooks can optionally include a setup cell with imported
        modules, which are written in the file as:

        <!-- note this setup cell is hardcoded in the playground example -->
        ```python
        with app.setup:
            import marimo as mo
            import dataclasses

        Modules imported in a setup cell can be used in "top-level" functions or
        classes. You can add the setup cell from the general menu of the editor under:

        ::lucide:diamond-plus:: Add setup cell

        ### Body cells

        Cells that are not saved as functions or classes are serialized as follows:

        def _(increment, a): # <- Signatures are automatically generated and consist of used references

            return (message,) # <- All used cell definitions are returned
