        # File Format

        marimo apps are stored as pure Python files.

        These files are:

        - ü§ñ legible for both humans and machines
        - ‚úèÔ∏è formattable using your tool of choice
        - ‚ûï easily versioned with git, producing small diffs
        - üêç usable as Python  scripts, with UI  elements taking their default values

        ## Example

        Consider a marimo notebook with the following four cells.

        First cell:
        ```python3
        print(text.value)
        ```

        Second cell:
        ```python3
        def say_hello(name="World"):
            return f"Hello, {name}!"
        ```

        Third cell:
        ```python3
        text = mo.ui.text(value=say_hello())
        text
        ```

        Fourth cell:
        ```python3
        import marimo as mo
        ```
        """
    )
    return


@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):
    mo.md(
        """
        For the above example, marimo would generate the following file
        contents:

        ```python3
        import marimo

        __generated_with = "0.0.0"
        app = marimo.App()

        @app.cell
        def _(text):
            print(text.value)
            return

        @app.function
        def say_hello(name="World"):
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

        @app.cell
        def _(mo):
            text = mo.ui.text(value="Hello, World!")
            text

            app.run()
        ```

        As you can see, this is _pure Python_. This is part of the reason why
        marimo's generated files are **git-friendly**: small changes made using
        the marimo editor result in small changes to the file that marimo
        generates.

        Moreover, the cell defining a single pure function `say_hello` was saved "top-level" in the notebook file, making it possible for you to import it into other Python files or notebooks.

        to work with, while also serving the needs of the marimo library. You can
        even edit the generated file's cells directly, using your favorite text
        editor, and format the file with your favorite code formatter.

        We explain some properties of marimo's file format below.

        In the `dataflow` tutorial, we saw that cells are like functions mapping
        their refs (the global  variables they uses but don't define) to their
        defs (the global variables they define). The generated code makes this
        analogy explicit.

        In the generated code, there is a function for each cell. The arguments
        of  the function are the cell's refs , and its returned variables are
        its defs.

        For example, the code

        ```python3
        @app.cell
        def _(mo):
            text = mo.ui.text(value="Hello, World!")
            text
            return text,
        ```

        says that the cell takes as input a variable called `mo`, and it creates
        a global variable called `text`.

        In contrast, the code

        ```python3
        @app.cell
        def _():
            import marimo as mo
            return mo,

        is  empty), though it does create the variable `mo` which the previous
        cell requires as input.

        ### Declaring imports used by functions and classes

        marimo can serialize functions and classes into the top-level of a file, so you can import them with regular Python syntax:

        ```python
        from my_notebook import my_function
        ```

        In particular, if a cell defines just a single function or class, and if that function or class is pure
        save for references to variables defined in a special **setup cell**, it will be serialized top-level.

        **Setup cell.** Notebooks can optionally include a setup cell that imports modules,
        written in the file as:

        <!-- note this setup cell is hardcoded in the playground example -->

        with app.setup:
            import marimo as mo
            import dataclasses

        Modules imported in a setup cell can be used in "top-level" functions or
        classes. You can add the setup cell from the general menu of the editor under:
        ::lucide:diamond-plus:: Add setup cell.
