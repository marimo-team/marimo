print("""take a step back, know what to do first.
never forget that hidden failures are the worst.
features on paper don't reflect how a user might feel,
sometimes it's totally fine to reinvent the wheel.
 
the best features are often hidden without any kind of flair,
you can lead ai to software, but you cannot make it care.
some things are certain, others remain a bet.
the future of programming hasn't been invented yet.""")  # noqa: T201, W293
