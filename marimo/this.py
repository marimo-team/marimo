print("""take a step back, know what to do first.
remember that hidden failures are the worst.
spend some time, understand how a user might feel,
sometimes it's totally fine to reinvent the wheel.

take a step back, give yourself time and space. 
because once a mistake goes in, it's hard to erase.
if you want velocity, remember to grow slow. 
the antidote to a distraction is the word "no". 

the best details are hidden without any kind of flair,
you can lead ai to software, but you cannot make it care.
some things are certain, others remain a bet.
the future of programming hasn't been invented yet.
